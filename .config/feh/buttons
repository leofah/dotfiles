# Feh (mouse) button Config

# the entries are  of  the  form "action [binding]".
#
# Each  binding  is a button number.  It may optionally start with modifiers for things like
# Control, in which case binding looks like mod-button (for example  C-1  for  Ctrl  +  Left
# button)

# Default config:
# 0 ⟨cursor movement while not panning, zooming, or similar⟩
#         Does not have a default binding.  By binding it to quit, you can turn feh  into  a
#         simple screensaver.
