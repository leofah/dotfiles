Here are the scripts I use for my Ubuntu System.
The most ones can be found as is on many other sources and may have been changed little for my use.
The most i3block scripts come with the installation of i3blocks. My own are programmed in shell, the given are perl.
The i3 scripts are mostly my own scripts. For the others i add the source in the corresponding scripts, but i may have changed little things.

The i3blocks and i3 scripts can currently also be found in my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/leofah/dotfiles) but i chose to seperate both repositories.
