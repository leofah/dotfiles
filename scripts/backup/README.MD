Backup
======

The backup scripts rely on the script [backup.rsync.raw](https://github.com/leofah/scripts/blob/master/backup/backup.rsync.raw) which I got from [Wiki Ubutuntuusers](https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Skripte/Backup_mit_RSYNC/)
This script is changed to my use of daily and weekly Backups with a defined mountpoint.

Encrypted
---------

I also created an encrypted backup (and the recover from this backup) based on the previous script. This script is not in use and not tested, so use at your own warranty.
