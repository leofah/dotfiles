Scripts
=======

Here are the scripts I use for my Ubuntu System with i3 window manager.
Most scripts can be found as is on many other sources and may have been changed little for my use.

i3blocks
-------

The most i3blocks scripts come with the installation of i3blocks. My scripts are programmed in shell, many given are in perl.
In scripts from another source I ad the source inside the file. Scripts without source are my own scripts.

dotfiles
--------

i3 and i3blocks scripts are referenced by my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/leofah/dotfiles).
