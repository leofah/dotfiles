Some of the backup scripts rely on the script backup.rsync.raw which I got from [Wiki Ubutuntuusers](https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Skripte/Backup_mit_RSYNC/)
they are an adaption to my use.
I also created a encrypted backup (and the recover from this backup) based on the previous script. I may change this script to use tar instead of rsync to preserve the file owners.
